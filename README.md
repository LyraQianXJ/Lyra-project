This should describe your code.

You can put blocks of code:

```python
for i in range(7):
  print(i**2)
```

or you can cite code in-line, like "the `for` loop was helpful because..."

Instead of saying "See the docstring for an example", give the example in the readme. Such as:

```python
>>> G=Graph([(0,2),(2,1),(1,3),(3,4),(4,2)])
>>> uniform(G)
Graph([(0, 2), (0, 5), (0, 6), (1, 2), (1, 3), (1, 7), (2, 4), (3, 4), (3, 8), (4, 9), (5, 6), (5, 9), (6, 7), (7, 8), (8, 9)])
```
